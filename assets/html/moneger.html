                <div class="projectDescription">
                    <p>After the success of the first project (Spshurl), the SpArrow team decided to embark on another project to create a full-stack application using the MERN stack. Moneger is a money managing web app that can track budgets and expenses. The user has to create an account to access the features in Moneger such as adding income and expenses, budget tracking, and expense categories. 
                    </p>
                    <p>My responsibilities in this project were the front-end developer/ designer, designing the web app from start to finish and implementing it in code using the JavaScript library, React. Moneger features an interactive 3D design on the home page made possible with the 3D JavaScript library, Three.js. This project allows me to gain experience in JSX, functional components, react hooks, states, and routing. While also gaining experience working with full-stack applications and databases.

            <div class="projectDescription">
                <p>This time round, I started designing a low-fidelity prototype on Figma using design systems and UI kits from the Figma community. This allows me to visually decide on the structure and the components that need to be created. The first iteration did not follow any design system but was just to give the team a rough idea of the style of the website.

            <div class="projectDescription">
                <p>After initial feedback from the team, I knew that I needed to follow an establised design system and using their provided UI kit to have a more coherent and consistent design throughout the webpage. The design system that I used was from Headway with their Shipwright UI kit.

                <p>Using an establised design system allows me to easily reuse components and makes the design process much faster. The next step was to design the webpage based on the design system.

                <p>The final design of Moneger features a 3D animation of coins floating on the homepage. The about us tab will show all members of the SpArrow team with their respective credentials. The dashboard can only be accessed after the user has created and is signed into his/ her account, allowing them to have access to their budget, expenses and incomes. 

                </p>
                <p>This project is currently still ongoing and making progress as we speak. I will continuously make updates to this page as the project continues further.

                <p>The graphs tab takes all the users shortened URLs and displays them on the dashboard. The user has a visual overview of the total website added and visits, all visitor locations around the world, and the top-visited websites with a graph that displays the top 5 most visited shortened URLs. The graphs tab also shows the total shortened URLs, the total number of people that have visited a Spshurl shortened URL, and the topmost visited shortened URL in our database.

                <p>To conclude and reflect on this project, considering this is the first-ever project from the SpArrow team and we completed this project in under 3 months, I consider this as a huge success. As for my contribution, I believe more areas in the front-end needs improving on but I am glad that I had the opportunity to learn from this experience and work with a team of excellent people. Huge shoutout to the team, @kaijie, @ben, @daniel for making this project a success. 
                </p>
                <p>The next project of the SpArrow team is to build a full-stack money managing web application using the MERN stack. The progress is updated regularly in my portfolio and can be seen <a href="./moneger.html" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</a>.
