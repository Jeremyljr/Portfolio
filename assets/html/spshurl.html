                <div class="projectDescription">
                    <p>This was the first project that started my journey into web development. I had the opportunity to work in a team called SpArrow which consists of myself and 3 other back-end developers. Spshurl is a web app that shortens long URLs. The user is provided with info about the number of times and location of a person that has clicked the shortened URL, a QR code associated with the URL, and have a visual overview on URL(s) usage from both local and global perspectives for all shortened URLs.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was responsible for all front-end code and responsive design where I used HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to built the front-end while the back-end utilised the Flask framework. To collaborate with the team members and have version control, we used Git and Github. External JavaScript libraries used in this project include Bootstrap, Gsap and Chart.js.
                    </p>
                    <p>It took only 3 months for the team to plan, design and develop Spshurl. The team also had the opportunity to collaborate with the Institution of Engineers Malaysia from the University of Pahang where Spshurl provided data for the number of visits and location of participants for the links to their virtual events.

                    When designing Spshurl, the teams wanted to go for a minimal dark theme. Frosted glass card design was the main theme for this web app as seen from the screenshots below. The primary and secondary colours are black and blue with an accent colour of orange. The typography of Spshurl is from the font family “Poppins”.
                </p>
                <p>I was solely responsible for all the front-end code and design of the web app and the screenshots below show all the pages of the Spshurl web app. The user is first greeted with the webpage details with the overall features of Spshurl. To be able to shorten a URL, the user must create an account. The about us section has the information to all the team members with the effect of cards stacking on each other and expanding card effects when hovered over.

                <p>Creating an account allows the user to access all his/ her shortened URLs at one location. Each of the URLs has a unique QR code that provides ease of URL sharing. Other information linked to each shortened URL are the title of the URL, the old and new links for the users' reference, and the number of visitors to the URL. 
                </p>
                <p>One of the features that were added for the collaboration with IEM UMP is the geolocation of the visitor that clicked on the URL and the number of clicks from each location. This feature was added to help the IEM team track the number and geolocation of participants who clicked on the links for their virtual events.

                <p>Spshurl provides its users with a visual overview of all the data associated with their shortened URLs, together with a global view of all shortened URLs in the Spshurl database. 
                </p>
                <p>The graphs tab takes all the users shortened URLs and displays them on the dashboard. The user has a visual overview of the total website added and visits, all visitor locations around the world, and the top-visited websites with a graph that displays the top 5 most visited shortened URLs. The graphs tab also shows the total shortened URLs, the total number of people that have visited a Spshurl shortened URL, and the topmost visited shortened URL in our database. 
                </p>
                <p>To conclude and reflect on this project, considering this is the first-ever project from the SpArrow team and we completed this project in under 3 months, I consider this as a huge success. As for my contribution, I believe more areas in the front-end needs improving on but I am glad that I had the opportunity to learn from this experience and work with a team of excellent people. Huge shoutout to the team, @kaijie, @ben, @daniel for making this project a success. 
                </p>
                <p>The next project of the SpArrow team is to build a full-stack money managing web application using the MERN stack. The progress is updated regularly in my portfolio and can be seen <a href="./moneger.html" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</a>.
